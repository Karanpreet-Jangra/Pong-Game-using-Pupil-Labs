# Pong Game using Pupil Labs Eye Tracker

## Master's Thesis Project

## Abstract

Eye tracking has been an evolving technology that facilitates hands-free human-computer interaction. This capability is the cornerstone for its ever-increasing application in scientific, research, and industrial applications. This project aims to design a timeless arcade game, the 2D Pong Game, on the Unity game platform, with the variation of using an Eye Tracker - the Pupil Labs Core Eye Tracker as an alternative interaction method.

## Key Features

- Eye-Controlled Gameplay: Use eye movements to control the paddle instead of traditional keyboard/mouse input.
- Unity Implementation: Built using Unity game engine.
- Pupil Labs Integration: Utilizes Pupil Labs Core Eye Tracker for precise eye movement detection with low-latency.

## Software Dependencies

- Unity Game Engine.
- Pupil Labs Software Stack.
- Pupil Labs API for Unity integration.

## Installation & Setup

1. *Clone the Repository*
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karanpreet-Jangra/Pong-Game-using-Pupil-Labs.git
   cd Pong-Game-using-Pupil-Labs
   ```

2. *Unity Setup*
   - Open the project in Unity.
   - Ensure all required packages are installed.
   - Import Pupil Labs Unity integration package.

3. *Eye Tracker Setup*
   - Install Pupil Labs software suite.
   - Calibrate the Pupil Labs Core Eye Tracker.
   - Ensure proper eye tracking functionality before running the game.

4. *Run the Project*
   - Open the main scene in Unity.
   - Press Play to start the eye-controlled Pong game.

## Usage

1. *Calibration*: Perform eye tracker calibration before starting the game.
2. *Gameplay*: Use eye movements to control the paddle position.
3. *Objective*: Prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score against the opponent.

## Research Applications

This project serves as a foundation for research in:
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
- Assistive technology development.
- Eye-tracking in gaming.
- Alternative input methods for gaming.

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-player eye-tracking support.
- Advanced game modes with eye-tracking challenges.
- Performance analytics and eye movement pattern analysis.
- Enhanced visual feedback systems.

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a Master's thesis exploring the integration of eye-tracking technology in interactive gaming environments. The work contributes to the understanding of alternative input methods and their potential applications in accessible gaming design.
